# 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Purchase Dataset

This project focuses on preprocessing and cleaning a raw dataset related to customer purchases. It demonstrates essential data preparation techniques needed before any meaningful analysis or machine learning can take place.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Format and standardize columns.
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Convert data types where necessary.
- Prepare a clean version of the dataset ready for further analysis.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used (`purchase_data.csv`) contains purchase records, including:
- Customer details
- Purchase categories
- Transaction amounts
- Date and time of transactions

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- Handling **NaN**, **null**, and **zero-value** entries.
- Using `pandas` for:
  - Filtering invalid or irrelevant records
  - Renaming and reformatting columns
  - Converting data types (e.g., dates, numerics)
  - Identifying and removing duplicates
- Data exploration (shape, types, descriptive stats) to guide cleaning steps.

---

## 🧪 Output

After processing, the cleaned dataset:
- Has consistent and meaningful values
- Is free of duplicates and format issues
- Is ready for downstream tasks like visualization or model training

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `purchase_data.csv` – original dataset
- `pandas+practice.py` – Python script with all preprocessing steps

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have `pandas` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
## 📌 Note
Cleaning and preprocessing is one of the most critical steps in any data pipeline. This project is a solid foundation for anyone looking to strengthen their real-world data handling skills.
